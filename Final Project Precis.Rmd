This data set is from the USDA's current food expenditures series. I plan to run analysis on certain variables, like expenditure at grocery stores, gas stations, etc., to assess the changes in spending on food and alcohol in different capacities. I have worked with consumer trends in the context of professional athletics, and I am interested in using this data to draw conclusions about more day-to-day consumer behaviors.
