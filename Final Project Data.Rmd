# I decided to do my data cleaning in an R markdown instead of an R script because it helps me to visually organize each of my data frames, joins, etc. 

# This chunk of data gathering/cleaning is dedicated to food expenditures. 

# USDA data on total nominal food and alcohol expenditures by purchasing location in the U.S from: 
# https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditure-series/ . 

expenditures <- read_excel("nominal_expenditures.xlsx", skip = 4, n_max = 21) %>%

# I wanted to focus solely on food expenditures, so I selected retail locations that either: 1. I was interested in or 2. showed/shows an interesting trend.  

food <- expenditures %>%
  select(year, grocery_stores, convenience_stores, mass_merchandisers, mail_order_and_home_delivery, home_production_and_donations, full_service_restaurants, hotels_and_motels, schools_and_colleges)

# I wanted to use expenditures per capita, rather than total expenditures, so I could compare it to my data on food availability. 
# Yearly population data from: 
# https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POPTOTUSA647NWDB . 

population <- read_excel("POPTOTUSA647NWDB.xls") %>%

# Joining the food expenditure data with tthe population data allowed me to isolated the variables I care about and make them into per capita expenditures.

# I multiplied each by 10000000 because the total expenditures is in millions of dollars, but I wanted it to be in dollars per person.

# This chunk of data gathering/cleaning is dedicated to food availability. 

# I gathered the USDA's data on different categories of food availability.

# I uploaded each excel file separately with the desired columns selected from the cleaning I did within the file before joining them.
